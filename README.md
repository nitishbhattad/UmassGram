# UmassGram

**UmassGram** is a full-stack social media web app built exclusively for UMass students. It combines essential social networking features with a restricted academic user base to build a sense of connection within the UMass community.

Designed as a portfolio-ready project, **UmassGram** showcases complete end-to-end web development — from Flask-based backend logic and structured MySQL database integration to a responsive, user-friendly frontend.

The project demonstrates:

🔐 **User authentication and session management** using Flask-Login, ensuring that only verified UMass users can log in and interact.  
🧩 **Modular Flask architecture** for clean, maintainable code organization.  
💬 **Core social features** like posting, liking, commenting, and following.  
🏫 **Community-focused design** tailored specifically for UMass students.

Overall, **UmassGram** represents a creative and technically strong example of modern full-stack web application development.
